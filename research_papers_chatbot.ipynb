However, the shipping, assembling and maintenance of the primary mirror are technical challenges. The primary mirror made of low-melting-point metal (LMPM) enables to simplify these procedures. The rotating liquid metal surface is shaped into a parabola and solidified on the site. The technological feasibility depends on the dynamic transformation of the parabolic LMPM mirror and its optical reflectance. The dynamic trans- formation of LMPM mirror was clarified by means of experiments with liquid gallium (Ga) which has a melting point of 302.91 K. The parabolic shape of solid Ga mirror was produced by the axial rotation and the solidifi- cation. The parabolic shape agreed with the theoretical curve obtained by a physical model. The reflectance spectra on the surface of various LMPMs solidified (i.e., Ga, lead (Pb), tin (Sn), bismuth (Bi), lead-bismuth eutectic (Pb-Bi) and Wood’s metal (Bi-Pb-Sn-Cd)) were measured. The reflectance of Ga solidified was approx- imately 70 % and was not degraded in the near-infrared wavelength due to the favorable optical characteristics. The reflectance both for p-polarized and s-polarized light of Ga solidified was measured by the spectropho- ◦ tometer with the polarizer at the angle of incidence of 30 . The trend of measured reflectance agreed with theoretical prediction.\\n\\n, 45\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n, 60\\n\\nand 75\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nTelescope was recently launched, and the diameter of the primary mirror is 6.5 m. These space telescopes have made great impacts to the astronomical science such as a characterization of exoplanets (Char- bonneau et al., 2002; Hinkly, 2022) and a discovery of galaxy formation in the early universe (Williams, 1996; Welch et al., 2022) and highly- redshifted objects. The discovery can be performed by the space obser- vation in infrared wavelength. The space telescopes with larger primary mirrors are being developed, and the improvements of thermal design (Li et al., 2016; Bannon et al., 2021) and vibration isolation system (Qin et al., 2020) have been studied. However, the mirrors are extremely vulnerable and the diameter to be transported is restricted by the size space ships. Therefore, the space transportation of larger primary mir- rors provides a critical challenge from a technological viewpoint.\\n\\nThe lunar surface is an attractive location for long-term astronomical observations using telescopes, since night-time hours are long as approximately 14 days and the astronomical observations are not affected by the atmosphere and weather conditions. The concept of lunar telescope (LT) has been proposed in the previous study, and the LT with 15 cm aperture mirror has been operated from 2013 (Meng et al., 2016). Artemis program will promote the exploration of the moon (Kumari et al., 2022; Evans and Graham, 2020).\\n\\nThe exploration of the early universe is one of the important topics to clarify the evolution of the universe. The infrared observations using space telescopes located in the outer space and/or on the moon at very low temperature will play an important role in the study of the early universe. The space telescopes with larger primary mirrors have higher angular resolution and light collecting power. Hubble Space Telescope is the optical/infrared space telescope operating on the orbit of the earth, and the diameter of the primary mirror is 2.4 m. James Webb Space\\n\\nThe concept of liquid metal telescope (LMT) has been studied (Ols- son-steel, 1986; Borra, 1982), and the LMT is operated in Canada (Kumar et al., 2018; Hickson et al., 2007). The spin of liquid mercury (Hg) which has a melting point of 234.32 K forms its parabolic mirror. The aperture diameter of LMT can be increased more easily than the\\n\\nCorresponding author.\\n\\nE-mail addresses: kondo.m.ai@m.titech.ac.jp (M. Kondo), y.hayano@nao.ac.jp (Y.

The opera- tion of LMT on the lunar surface (Klimas, 2010) enables to observe distant objects which are not followed up with ground-based telescopes (Angel, 2006; Angel et al., 2008). However, the LMT cannot point at off- zenith (out-of-plane tip/tilt) angles since the liquid mirror cannot be tilted. The Zenith program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is going to investigate and develop technologies to facilitate demonstration of LMT and liquid mirror that can be pointed at off-zenith (out-of-plane tip/tilt) angles.\\n\\nLMPM layer can reduce the total weight of the mirror which is major driver of the shipping cost.\\n\\nThe building of space telescopes with the parabolic LMPM mirror is rather simple. The LMPM melted is placed on the shell assembled, and axial rotation of the shell with the LMPM melted shapes the parabolic mirror on the site. The heat and electricity are required only in the shaping procedure of the parabolic mirror. High precision is not required for the assembling of the shell with support system, though it is required for the assembling of segmented mirrors. The transformation on the orbit of the earth is also possible by the use of thrust-for-gravity. The Lunar Liquid Mirror Telescope (LLMT) with a silver coated ionic liquid was recently proposed (Borra et al., 2007). The LMPM mirror revealed similar reflectivity to the LLMT without the deposition of a reflective metal on the surface as described in a latter chapter.\\n\\nThe present paper proposes a concept of large primary solid mirror usable for space telescopes, which is made of low-melting-point metal (LMPM). This concept enables the on-site transformation of solid mirror by the axial rotation and solidification of liquid metal on the moon and/ or in the space. The LMPM mirror can be operated at very low tem- perature for infrared observations as the same as conventional solid mirrors. The LMPM mirror can observe the whole sky since the obser- vation angle of the mirror is changeable due to the tilt of the mirror. The LMPM mirror is assembled on the site after the shipping to the space and the moon in the parts of liquid metal filled in the container and the support system disassembled. Therefore, the size of LMPM mirror is not limited by the size of space ships as the same as the LMT. The LMPM mirror can be applied also for robust final optics in a laser inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant, since it can be easily repaired when the mirror has a cumulative damage via neutron irradiation during the reactor operation. However, the reflective performance of the solidified LMPMs is not made clear so far.\\n\\nThe telescope with LMPM mirror is operated in the same way as conventional solid mirrors on the site as shown in Fig. 1(b). Neither heating or rotating are not required during the operation of the LMPM mirror. The LMPM mirror can be tilted, though liquid mirror cannot be tilted basically. The melting of the mirror by the radiation heat from the sun must be eliminated during the operation of the telescope. The ra- diation heat from the sun is needed to be insulated by a sun shield. The LMPM mirror can be operated at very low temperature for the infrared observations, which is required for the study on the early universe.\\n\\nThe focal length of the LMPM mirror is adjustable by changing the axial rotation speed during the solidification process. The parabolic mirror having a longer focal length is obtained under a slower rotational speed, and that having a shorter focal length is obtained under a faster rotational speed. The mirror with a longer focal length enables to observe an enlarged view of a narrow field. The mirror with a shorter focal length enables to observe wider view field brightly. Therefore, the transformable LMPM mirror enables to observe astronomical objects at various magnification by changing the focal length.\\n\\nThe purpose of the present study is to clarify the reflectance of LMPM mirrors, which are fabricated by natural cooling. The dynamic trans- formation of parabolic LMPM mirror by an axial rotation and solidifi- cation was also studied.\\n\\nThe primary mirror located in space telescopes is irradiated with cosmic rays, and the mirror is then assumed to be damaged and degraded. The LMPM mirror can be easily repaired according to the melting and solidification under the rotational condition. The mainte- nance of the LMPM mirror is simpler than that of solid mirrors.\\n\\n2. Concept of low-melting-point metal mirrors usable for space telescopes\\n\\nTable 1 presents the major properties of candidate LMPMs (Carvill, 1994; Duggin, 1969; Bang et al., 2003; Benamati and Sobolev, 2007). Their melting-points are in the range between 302.9 K and 600.6 K. Fig. 1 shows the conceptual design of the LMPM mirrors. The LMPM melted is filled in the simple shell and the shell is axially rotated at a constant angular velocity. The liquid LMPM transforms into the para- bolic shape by the axial rotation as the same as the shaping procedure of liquid mirrors, and the parabolic shape is kept by the cooling and so- lidification as indicated in Fig. 1(a). This shaping procedure is per- formed on the site. Here, the parabolic shape was determined by the inertial and gravitational forces as explained in a latter chapter.\\n\\n3. Experimental conditions\\n\\n3.1. Dynamic transformation and solidification of liquid LMPM into parabolic shape\\n\\nThe dynamic transformation of parabolic LMPM mirrors was inves- tigated by means of the experiments with the apparatus shown in Fig. 2. The experiments were performed in an air atmosphere at atmospheric pressure. The liquid gallium (Ga) which has a melting point of 302.9 K (Table 1) was poured into the crucible (316L) at approximately 330 K. The crucible was rotated axially by the motor. The rotational speed was measured with a transmission-type photosensor. The rotational speeds were 50 rpm, 100 rpm, 150 rpm and 200 rpm. The liquid Ga was so- lidified by natural cooling at room temperature under the axial rotation. The surface height of the Ga solidified was measured by the distance sensor which was installed in the apparatus.\\n\\nThe LMPM mirror can be scaled up without the restriction of the shipping and assembling as the same as the liquid mirror. The LMPM mirror is separately shipped to the space and/or the moon in the parts of LMPM filled in the container and the support system disassembled. The shell of the mirror is also shipped in the small parts, and they were assembled on the site. Therefore, the diameter of the mirror to be transported is not limited by the size of space ships.

The specimens of 316L austenitic steel, Pb, Bi and Sn were embedded in resin for the mechanical polish. Their surface were sequentially polished by SiC papers of #500, #1200, #2000 and #4000 under wet condition (i.e., with water as a lubricant). The surface of some specimens was finished with colloidal silica (Par- ticle diameter: 0.25 µm) or water-based diamond suspension (Diamond size: 0.25 µm). The arithmetic mean surface roughness of all the speci- mens was measured with a 3D scanning laser microscope (SFT-4500, SHIMADZU CORPORAION, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto, Japan).

The surface roughness was controlled in the range between 0.273 µm and 0.011 µm. The reflectance of specimens which had various surface roughness was measured to clarify the effect of surface roughness on the reflectance.\\n\\nwhere ω [rad/s] is angular velocity, g [m/s2] is gravitational accel- eration and χ [m] is a horizontal distance from the center. The liquid Ga was naturally cooled and solidified under the rotating condition. The solid parabolic mirror was then obtained as shown in Fig. 4(b and c). The solid green line is approximate curve obtained by the curve fitting as quadratic function of surface shape formed in the experiment. This fitting curve was obtained for the experimental values in the range of 0< x <10 mm to eliminate the effect of deformation around the inner wall of the crucible (i.e., x=±13) possibly due to the surface tension of liquid Ga. The meniscus of liquid Ga was formed around the inner wall of the crucible in the rotating condition.\\n\\n3.3. Measurement of reflectance on surface of low-melting-point metal specimens\\n\\nThe reflectance of solidified LMPM specimens was evaluated by relative specular reflectance measurement with the spectrophotometer (SolidSpec-3700, SHIMADZU CORPORATION, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto, Japan) as shown in Fig. 3(a), which is installed in National Astronomical Ob- servatory of Japan (NAOJ). The reflectance of the LMPM specimens was based on the intensity ratio between the incident light and the light detected by the detector. The wavelength of incident light was varied in the range between ultraviolet and near infrared (300–2000 nm). The ◦ angle of incidence was 15 in all the measurements of optical reflectance.\\n\\nThe surface shape of Ga solidified at the rotational speed of 50 rpm did not agree well with the parabolic curve (blue solid line) given by Eq. (1) as shown in Fig. 4(b). The surface height around the inner wall of the crucible in the experiment was higher than that of the curve given by Eq. (1). This difference was caused by the upward force applied to liquid Ga by the formation of meniscus.\\n\\nThe surface shape of Ga solidified at the rotational speed of 150 rpm agreed well with the parabolic curve (blue solid line) given by Eq. (1) as shown in Fig. 4(c). However, the surface height of Ga solidified around the inner wall of the crucible was lower than the parabolic curve. This difference was caused by the downward force applied to liquid Ga for the formation of meniscus.\\n\\nThe reflectance of the specimens which had various surface rough- ness (Table 4) was also measured. Fig. 3(b and c) show the examples of the specimens. A lot of needles were recognized on the surface of so- lidified Wood’s metal specimen as shown in Fig. 3(c) according the precipitation of intermetallic compounds during the solidification procedure.\\n\\nThe root mean squared error (RMSE) between the surface shape obtained in the experiment and the theory was estimated in the range of 0< x <10 mm. RMSEs in the experiment at the rotational speeds of 50 rpm and 150 rpm was 148 μm and 105 μm, respectively. The shape of rotating liquid Ga around the inner wall of the crucible was mainly determined by centrifugal force and the formation of meniscus. The centrifugal force was smaller when the rotational speed was smaller. Therefore, the effect of meniscus on the shape was more clearly recog- nized when the centrifugal force was smaller at the lower rotational speed.\\n\\nThe optical reflectance depends on the angle of incidence due to the polarization effect. The measurement of polarized optical reflectance on the surface of solidified Ga was then performed both for p-polarized and s-polarized lights. The vibration direction of p-polarized light is parallel to the plane of incidence. On the other hand, the vibration direction of s- polarized light is vertical to the plane of incidence. The optical reflec- tance for p-polarized and s-polarized lights on solidified Ga was measured with the spectrophotometer with the polarizer. The wave- length of incident light was 689 nm, and the angles of incidence were 30\\n\\n\\n\\n, 45\\n\\n, 60\\n\\nand 75\\n\\nin the measurements.\\n\\nThese results indicate that the parabolic mirrors can be shaped by the solidification of rotating liquid LMPM. The effect of the solidification procedure on the production of parabolic shape was negligibly small,\\n\\nFig. 3.

The Strehl ratio of Ga solidified is then estimated as 95.9 % at the wavelength of 1500 nm by Eq. (2). The Strehl ratio higher than 80 % is given as ideal mirror. This Strehl ratio of Ga solidified is sufficiently high when the wavelength of the incident light is in the near-infrared range.\\n\\n4.2. Reflectance of low-melting-point metal specimens\\n\\n4.2.1.

Fig. 5(d) shows the surface con- ditions of Wood’s metal specimen which was naturally cooled and so- lidified. The surface roughness was 0.748 µm. The reflected image of the mark drawn on the white plate was not recognized at all, since the surface condition was rough due to the precipitation of intermetallic compounds. The surface roughness of Ga solidified was 0.049 µm, and this surface roughness was the smallest in all the solidified specimens as presented in Table 3.\\n\\n(n (cid:0) 1)2 + κ2 (n + 1)2 + κ2\\n\\nR =\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwhere R is reflectance, n is refractive index, and κ is extinction co- efficient. Here, the incident light is vertically irradiated onto the metal surface. The value of optical constants, n and κ, depend on the wave- length of light. The theoretical reflectance of Ga was estimated from Eq. (4) with the optical constants of Ga provided in the previous study (Adachi, 2012). The theoretical reflectance is shown with vacant circles in Fig. 6(b), and the trend agrees well with the reflectance measured in the experiment. The reflectance of Ga does not decrease even at a shorter wavelength in theory. The reflectance of Ga is not affected even when the wavelength is short, since Ga has favorable optical characteristics. The Ga solidified can be a promising material of the LMPM mirror usable for the astronomical science, since it has higher optical reflectance than the other LMPMs in the near-infrared wavelength based on the present results.\\n\\nFig. 6 shows the reflectance spectra of the LMPM surface in the wavelength range between ultraviolet and near infrared (300–2000 nm) measured in the experiment. The LMPMs of Sn, Bi, Pb and 316L which were sequentially polished by SiC papers of #500, #1200, #2000 and #4000 revealed smaller reflectance when the wavelength of incident light was shorter as shown in Fig. 6(a). The reflectance of Ga solidified was higher than the other LMPMs solidified. The reflectance of Sn, Pb, Bi, Wood’s metal and LBE specimens solidified was lower than the specimen polished as shown in Fig. 6(b). The reason of the low optical reflectance was due to the precipitation of the crystals and intermetallic compounds on their surface during the cooling down and solidification procedures.\\n\\n4.2.3.

The photon which has larger energy can easily penetrate into the matrix of metal through the surface. The photon which penetrates into the metal is not specularly reflected on the surface, and it can be refracted and reflected inside the metal matrix. The photon cannot be detected by the detector of spec- trophotometer in the experiment, and the optical reflectance became lower.

The parabolic shape of the Ga mirror agreed well with that based on theoretical prediction. The optical reflectance spectra on the flat surface of LMPMs (Ga, Sn, Pb, Bi, Wood’s metal and lead- bismuth eutectic) were measured by the spectrophotometer. The opti- cal reflectance for p-polarized and s-polarized lights on the surface of Ga solidified was also measured with the spectrophotometer with the polarizer. The LMPMs revealed higher optical reflectance when their surface roughness was lower and the wavelength of incident light was longer. The optical reflectance of solidified Ga which had a surface roughness of 0.049 µm was approximately 70 %. The reflectance on the surface of Ga solidified was rather high even when the wavelength was shorter due to the favorable optical characteristics.\\n\\nBorra, E.F., Seddiki, O., Angel, R., Eisenstein, D., Hickson, P., Seddon, K.R., Worden, S.P., 2007.

              " 'The installation of telescopes with larger primary mirrors in outer space is required for the study of the early universe. However, the shipping, assembling and maintenance of the primary mirror are technical challenges. The primary mirror made of low-melting-point metal (LMPM) enables to simplify these procedures. The rotating liquid metal surface is shaped into a parabola and solidified on the site. The technological feasibility depends on the dynamic transformation of the parabolic LMPM mirror and its optical reflectance. The dynamic trans- formation of LMPM mirror was clarified by means of experiments with liquid gallium (Ga) which has a melting point of 302.91 K. The parabolic shape of solid Ga mirror was produced by the axial rotation and the solidifi- cation. The parabolic shape agreed with the theoretical curve obtained by a physical model. The reflectance spectra on the surface of various LMPMs solidified (i.e., Ga, lead (Pb), tin (Sn), bismuth (Bi), lead-bismuth eutectic (Pb-Bi) and Wood’s metal (Bi-Pb-Sn-Cd)) were measured. The reflectance of Ga solidified was approx- imately 70 % and was not degraded in the near-infrared wavelength due to the favorable optical characteristics. The reflectance both for p-polarized and s-polarized light of Ga solidified was measured by the spectropho- ◦ tometer with the polarizer at the angle of incidence of 30 . The trend of measured reflectance agreed with theoretical prediction.',\n",

These space telescopes have made great impacts to the astronomical science such as a characterization of exoplanets (Char- bonneau et al., 2002; Hinkly, 2022) and a discovery of galaxy formation in the early universe (Williams, 1996; Welch et al., 2022) and highly- redshifted objects. The discovery can be performed by the space obser- vation in infrared wavelength. The space telescopes with larger primary mirrors are being developed, and the improvements of thermal design (Li et al., 2016; Bannon et al., 2021) and vibration isolation system (Qin et al., 2020) have been studied. However, the mirrors are extremely vulnerable and the diameter to be transported is restricted by the size space ships. Therefore, the space transportation of larger primary mir- rors provides a critical challenge from a technological viewpoint.',\n",
              " 'The lunar surface is an attractive location for long-term astronomical observations using telescopes, since night-time hours are long as approximately 14 days and the astronomical observations are not affected by the atmosphere and weather conditions. The concept of lunar telescope (LT) has been proposed in the previous study, and the LT with 15 cm aperture mirror has been operated from 2013 (Meng et al., 2016). Artemis program will promote the exploration of the moon (Kumari et al., 2022; Evans and Graham, 2020).',\n",

The opera- tion of LMT on the lunar surface (Klimas, 2010) enables to observe distant objects which are not followed up with ground-based telescopes (Angel, 2006; Angel et al., 2008). However, the LMT cannot point at off- zenith (out-of-plane tip/tilt) angles since the liquid mirror cannot be tilted. The Zenith program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is going to investigate and develop technologies to facilitate demonstration of LMT and liquid mirror that can be pointed at off-zenith (out-of-plane tip/tilt) angles.',\n",
              " 'LMPM layer can reduce the total weight of the mirror which is major driver of the shipping cost.\\n\\nThe building of space telescopes with the parabolic LMPM mirror is rather simple. The LMPM melted is placed on the shell assembled, and axial rotation of the shell with the LMPM melted shapes the parabolic mirror on the site. The heat and electricity are required only in the shaping procedure of the parabolic mirror. High precision is not required for the assembling of the shell with support system, though it is required for the assembling of segmented mirrors. The transformation on the orbit of the earth is also possible by the use of thrust-for-gravity. The Lunar Liquid Mirror Telescope (LLMT) with a silver coated ionic liquid was recently proposed (Borra et al., 2007). The LMPM mirror revealed similar reflectivity to the LLMT without the deposition of a reflective metal on the surface as described in a latter chapter.',\n",
              " 'The present paper proposes a concept of large primary solid mirror usable for space telescopes, which is made of low-melting-point metal (LMPM). This concept enables the on-site transformation of solid mirror by the axial rotation and solidification of liquid metal on the moon and/ or in the space. The LMPM mirror can be operated at very low tem- perature for infrared observations as the same as conventional solid mirrors. The LMPM mirror can observe the whole sky since the obser- vation angle of the mirror is changeable due to the tilt of the mirror. The LMPM mirror is assembled on the site after the shipping to the space and the moon in the parts of liquid metal filled in the container and the support system disassembled. Therefore, the size of LMPM mirror is not limited by the size of space ships as the same as the LMT. The LMPM mirror can be applied also for robust final optics in a laser inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant, since it can be easily repaired when the mirror has a cumulative damage via neutron irradiation during the reactor operation. However, the reflective performance of the solidified LMPMs is not made clear so far.',\n",

Neither heating or rotating are not required during the operation of the LMPM mirror. The LMPM mirror can be tilted, though liquid mirror cannot be tilted basically. The melting of the mirror by the radiation heat from the sun must be eliminated during the operation of the telescope. The ra- diation heat from the sun is needed to be insulated by a sun shield. The LMPM mirror can be operated at very low temperature for the infrared observations, which is required for the study on the early universe.',\n",

The parabolic mirror having a longer focal length is obtained under a slower rotational speed, and that having a shorter focal length is obtained under a faster rotational speed. The mirror with a longer focal length enables to observe an enlarged view of a narrow field. The mirror with a shorter focal length enables to observe wider view field brightly. Therefore, the transformable LMPM mirror enables to observe astronomical objects at various magnification by changing the focal length.\\n\\nThe purpose of the present study is to clarify the reflectance of LMPM mirrors, which are fabricated by natural cooling. The dynamic trans- formation of parabolic LMPM mirror by an axial rotation and solidifi- cation was also studied.',\n",
